# Project Generator

Utility to automate creation of projects I typically use for rapid prototyping.

## Todos:
* Replace build step with `ts-node`
* Add ability to run commands as part of project creation
  * Run git init as part of all project creation
* Add example uses to readme
* Automatically populate readme with list from templates folder?
* Add ability to describe secondary steps to templates (e.g. ask whether to add routing in react apps)
